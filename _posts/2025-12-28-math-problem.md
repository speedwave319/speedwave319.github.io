In the video game _Minecraft_, for each loaded chunk, every tick there is a $\frac{1}{100000}$ chance of  lightning strike during a thunderstorm. Assume a thunderstorm is currently active. 
(Given: $1$ second $= 20$ ticks)

(a) Find the expected value of lightning striking in $1$ chuck in $30$ minutes.

(b) Using the value in (a), or otherwise, find the probability there are at least $1$ lighting strike in 1 loaded chuck in $30$ minutes. 

(hint: you may assume the probability follows the poisson distribution).

(c) The weather is considered _severe_ when more than $9$ chucks have at least $1$ lighting strike over a $30$ minute period. 

(i) Find the probability that the weather is _severe_ when $12$ chunks are loaded.

(ii) Given that the weather is severe, find the probability that there are at least 12 lightning strikes in total across 12 chunks during the 30‑minute period.

(d) In one chunk, how long does it take for the first lightning strike to occur where the probability is higher than $0.4$? Express your answer in minutes.
