In the video game _Minecraft_, for each loaded chunk, every tick there is a $\frac{1}{100000}$ chance of  lightning strike during a thunderstorm.
(Given: $1$ second $= 20$ ticks)

(a) Find the expected value of lightning strikes in $1$ chuck in $30$ minutes.

(b) Using the value in (a), or otherwise, find the probability there are at least $1$ lighting strike in 1 loaded chuck in $30$ minutes. 

(hint: you may assume the probability follows the poisson distribution).

(c) The weather is considered _severe_ when more than 9 chucks have at least $1$ lighting strike over a $30$ minute period. Assume 12 chunks are loaded.

Find the probability that the weather is _severe_.

(d) In one chunk, how long does it take for the first lightning strike to occur where the probability is higher than $0.5$? Express your answer in minutes.
