#Hello World 

Hello this is my blog. I suck at html

---

Consider the curve \( \Gamma \) defined by the function:


$$
y = a(x - 1)^3 + b(x - 1)^2 + cx + 2
$$

where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants. It is given that the curve has a **maximum point at \( x = 1 \)**.

---

### (a)  
Show that \( c = 0 \).

---

### (b)  
Given that the y-intercept of \( \Gamma \) is 1 and that \( ab = 6 \):

1. \$$ Show that there are two possible values of \( a \).  
2. \$$ Find the other extreme point(s) of \( \Gamma \).

---

### (c)  
Find the other extreme point(s) of \( \Gamma \) .
