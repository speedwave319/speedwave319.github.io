#Hello World 

Hello this is my blog. I suck at html

## Consider the curve $\Gamma$ : $y = a(x - 1)^3 + b(x - 1)^2 + cx + 2$, where $a$ , $b$, and $c$ are constants. It is given that the curve has a maximum point of $\Gamma$  at $x = 1$.


## (a) Find $c$.

## (b) It is given that the y-intercept of $\Gamma$ is $1$ and $ab = 6$.

##     (i) Someone claims that there are two possible values of $a$. Do you agree? Explain your answer.
##     (ii) Find the other extreme point(s) of $\Gamma$.
